        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            <em>High School</em><br />
            My senior year of high school, I was the salutatorian. I maintained a 3.8 GPA
            while being an all-state athlete in football and track.

        <p>
            <em>College</em><br />
            I'll admit, I had a rough first year of College. I dropped out mid way through my second semester with a
            poor GPA.
            I have since returned to school (obviously) and done decently well with my classes.
        </p><br />


        <p>
            <em>Employment</em><br />
            I started working when I was 13. I worked for a farmer in Power, MT from 8th grade until I graduated.<br />
            In May of 2018, I worked for Mitchell's Crash Repair working on vehicles for about a month.<br />
            I started working at SCHEELS in June of 2018 and am still employed there. I sell 'hard goods' such as guns,
            ammo,
            reloading supplies, huning boots and clothing, and grills.
